# Simple Battle #

## About ##

Simple Battle is my take on adapting a project that I started at the beginning of 2020. The project which this is based on is [Simple Application](https://github.com/mrthunder/SimpleApplication).

This project is going to be a little different from the console application. I intend to make the battle system work and have it available as version 1.0 of this project. However, I will continue developing other features for this project and expanding from just a simple battle system to a simple RPG demo; Where a player can wander around an area and battle against monsters.

## Specs ##
I am using **Unreal Engine 4.24.3** and **Visual Studio ~~2019~~ 2017** (Once I updated my VS2019, it wouldn't open any project).
